Credit card fraud is a major concern for both consumers and financial institutions. Fraudulent transactions can lead to financial losses and damage to the reputation of financial institutions. Machine learning techniques have been used extensively to detect fraudulent transactions. In this project, we use logistic regression to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on their features.
We use logistic regression to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on their features. Logistic regression is a widely used classification algorithm that models the probability of an event occurring based on input features. The logistic regression model is trained on the training data using the LogisticRegression () function from scikit-learn. The trained model is then used to predict the target variable for the testing data.
